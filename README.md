# AISHIP Ontology

## Overview
AISHIP is an ontology for integrating and semantically enriching heterogeneous maritime data. It extends the VesselAI ontology with:

* Enhanced vessel characteristics
* Extended trajectory information
* Multimodal vessel descriptions (images, sonar, text)
* Detailed propulsion system modeling

AISHIP enables semantic interoperability, supporting applications like fleet management, search & rescue, and digital twins.

## Key Features
Unified representation of vessel data

* Support for AIS data, trajectories, and contextual info
* Propulsion systems and engine specifications
* Multimodal data integration (images, sonar, text)
* QUDT-based unit semantics for numeric values
